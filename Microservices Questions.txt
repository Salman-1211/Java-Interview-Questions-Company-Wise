----------------------------------------------> Microservices <--------------------------------------------------------

Q.1 microservices vs monolithic, process to convert monolithic to microservices, 
	connect sql db to microservice.
-> 
	# Microservices architecture is a distributed approach where each service 
	  is independent and can be developed, deployed, and scaled separately.

	# Monolithic architecture is a traditional approach where the entire 
	  application is developed as a single unit.

	# To convert a monolithic application to microservices, identify the 
	  business capabilities and separate them into individual services.

	# Use API gateways to manage communication between services 
	  and implement fault tolerance and resiliency.

	# To connect SQL DB to microservices, use a database per service approach 
	  or a shared database approach with caution.

	# In a database per service approach, each service has its own database, 
	  while in a shared database approach, multiple services share a single database.

	# Consider using a tool like Flyway or Liquibase for database migrations.
