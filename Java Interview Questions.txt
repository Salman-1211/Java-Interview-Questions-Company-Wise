-------------------------------------------------------------------------> JAVA INTERVIEW QUESTIONS <-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q.1 What are the Java 8 Features?
--> 
1.Lambda Features :-
	Purpose: Enables functional programming and simplifies the implementation of interfaces with a single abstract method (Functional Interfaces).
	Syntax: (parameters) -> expression/body
		
		List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
		names.forEach(name -> System.out.println(name));
	Benefits:
		1.Reduces boilerplate code.
		2.Simplifies event handling and iterations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.StreaM APIs :- 
	Purpose: Simplifies processing of collections and large datasets.
	Features:
		1.Operations can be intermediate (e.g., filter, map) or terminal (e.g., collect, forEach).
		2.Supports lazy evaluation and parallel processing.
	Example:
		List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
		List<Integer> squares = numbers.stream()
                               		       .map(n -> n * n)
                                               .collect(Collectors.toList());
		System.out.println(squares);
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.Functional Interface :- 
	Definition: An interface with exactly one abstract method. Examples include Runnable, Callable, and Comparator.
	New Interfaces:
		Predicate<T>: Represents a condition (returns a boolean).
		Function<T, R>: Maps a value of type T to R.
		Consumer<T>: Performs an operation on T.
		Supplier<T>: Supplies a value of T.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.Optional :-
	Purpose: Helps avoid NullPointerException by providing a container for nullable values.
	e.g:- 
	Optional<String> optional = Optional.ofNullable(getValue());
	optional.ifPresent(System.out::println); // Prints value if present
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.New Date & Time API :-
	Purpose: Provides a more robust and immutable date-time API.
	Classes:
		-> LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime: Represent dates, times, and combined datetime.
		-> Period, Duration: Represent time intervals.
		-> DateTimeFormatter: Formats date-time objects.
	Example:
		LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
		System.out.println(date);

Q.2 What are the 4 pillers/Concepts of Oops?
->
  1.Abstraction
  2.Encapsulations
  3.Inheritance
  4.Polymorphism

1.Abstraction : It is a process of hiding the implementation details 
		and showing only fuctionality to the user.

	Real World Examples:
	
	TV remote : To start TV, you have to press the power button, 
		    you don't have to know about the internal circuit operations
		    like how infrared waves are passing.

	In Java, Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:
		1.Abstract Class
		2.Interfaces

2.Encapsulation: It is process of Binding data and methods within a class. Think
		of it like showing the essential deatils of a class by using access control 
		modifiers(public,private,protected).
	Example:
		Java Bean,where all data members are made private and you define certain public
		methods to the outside world to access them.


3.Inheritance: Using inheritance means defining a parent-child relationship between
			       classes,by doing so, you can reuse the code that is already defined in 
			       parent class. Code reusability is the biggest advantage of Inheritance.
				
		               Java does not allow multiple inheritance through classes but it allows 
			       it through interfaces.

4.Polymorphism: Ploy means many and Morph means forms.
		Polymorphism is the process in which an object or fuction takes differnt forms.
		There are 2 types of Polymorphism:
			1.Compile time Polymorphism(Method Overloading)
			2.Run Time Polymorphism(Method overriding)

		In Method overloading, two or more method i n one class have the same method name but
		different arguments.It is called as Compile time polymorphism because it is decided at compile
		time which overloaded method will be called.

		Overriding means when we have twomethods with same name and same parameters in parent & child 
		class.Through overriding, child class can provide specific implementation for the method which is already
		defined in the parent class.
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================

1. Abstract Class:
			An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and can contain 
			both abstract (unimplemented) methods and concrete (implemented) methods.

	Features:
		-> Use the abstract keyword.
		-> Can have fields, constructors, and implemented methods.
		-> Subclasses must provide implementations for the abstract methods unless they are abstract themselves.

	Example:
		Real-Life Example: Electronic Devices
		
		 code
		abstract class ElectronicDevice {
    			// Abstract method (no implementation)
    			abstract void turnOn();
    			abstract void turnOff();

    		// Concrete method (implementation provided)
   	 	void powerSupply() {
       			 System.out.println("Device is connected to power.");
   		 }
	}

		class Television extends ElectronicDevice {
    			@Override
    			void turnOn() {
       				 System.out.println("Television is On.");
    		}

    			@Override
    			void turnOff() {
        			System.out.println("Television is Off.");
    		}
	}

		class Radio extends ElectronicDevice {
    			@Override
    			void turnOn() {
       				 System.out.println("Radio is On.");
    		}

    			@Override
    			void turnOff() {
        			System.out.println("Radio is Off.");
    		}
	}

	public class Main {
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
        	
		ElectronicDevice tv = new Television();
        	tv.turnOn();
        	tv.powerSupply();
        	tv.turnOff();

        	ElectronicDevice radio = new Radio();
        	radio.turnOn();
        	radio.powerSupply();
        	radio.turnOff();
    		}
	}
	Explanation:
		The ElectronicDevice class defines a template with abstract methods 
		(turnOn and turnOff) and a concrete method (powerSupply).
		Subclasses Television and Radio provide specific implementations for the abstract methods.
=====================================================================================================================================================================================	
2. Interface:
		An interface is a blueprint for a class that contains only method declarations 
		(and default/static methods from Java 8 onwards). A class implementing the interface 
		must provide implementations for all its methods.

	Features:
		Use the interface keyword.
		Methods are implicitly public and abstract (except default and static methods).
		A class can implement multiple interfaces (unlike inheritance, which is limited to one class).
	
	Example:
		Real-Life Example: Payment System
		
		code:

		interface Payment {
    			void makePayment();
		}

		class CreditCardPayment implements Payment {
    			@Override
    			public void makePayment() {
        			System.out.println("Payment made using Credit Card.");
    		}
	}

		class PayPalPayment implements Payment {
    			@Override
    			public void makePayment() {
        			System.out.println("Payment made using PayPal.");
    		}
	}

		public class Main {
    			public static void main(String[] args) {
        			Payment payment1 = new CreditCardPayment();
       				payment1.makePayment();

        			Payment payment2 = new PayPalPayment();
        			payment2.makePayment();
    		}
	}
	Explanation:
			The Payment interface defines the method makePayment.
			CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment classes implement the 
			interface and provide their own implementations.

Q.6 Exceptional Handling in java?
-> 
Key Terms:-
	Exception: An event that disrupts the normal flow of a program during runtime.
	
	Error: Represents serious problems (e.g., OutOfMemoryError) that applications typically should not handle.
	
	Checked Exceptions: Exceptions checked at compile time (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
	
	Unchecked Exceptions: Exceptions not checked at compile time, also called runtime exceptions (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException).
	
	Throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
	
	Throws: Declares exceptions a method might throw.

Exception Handling Keywords:-
	
	try: Defines a block of code to test for exceptions.

	catch: Defines a block to handle the exceptions.

	finally: A block that always executes, regardless of exceptions.

	throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception.

	throws: Declares exceptions that a method may throw.

Basic Example

	public class ExceptionExample {
    	public static void main(String[] args) {
        	try {
            		int a = 10 / 0; // ArithmeticException
        	} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            		System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
        	} finally {
            		System.out.println("Execution completed.");
        	}
    	   }
	}
Output:
	Cannot divide by zero!
	Execution completed.


Flow of Exception Handling:- 
	# When an exception occurs, the program's normal flow is interrupted.
	# The control moves to the nearest catch block that can handle the exception.
 	# The finally block (if present) is executed after the try-catch block.


Common Types of Exceptions:-
	
		Exception			Description
	ArithmeticException		Dividing a number by zero.
	NullPointerException		Accessing a null object reference.
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException	Accessing an invalid index in an array.
	ClassNotFoundException		Class not found during runtime.
	IOException			Input-output operation failures (e.g., file not found).
	SQLException			Errors during database access.


Exception Handling in Java is a mechanism to handle runtime errors, ensuring the program's normal flow is maintained. Java provides robust support for catching, managing, and recovering from exceptions.

Key Terms
Exception: An event that disrupts the normal flow of a program during runtime.
Error: Represents serious problems (e.g., OutOfMemoryError) that applications typically should not handle.
Checked Exceptions: Exceptions checked at compile time (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
Unchecked Exceptions: Exceptions not checked at compile time, also called runtime exceptions (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException).
Throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
Throws: Declares exceptions a method might throw.

Flow of Exception Handling
When an exception occurs, the program's normal flow is interrupted.
The control moves to the nearest catch block that can handle the exception.
The finally block (if present) is executed after the try-catch block.
Common Types of Exceptions
Exception	Description
ArithmeticException	Dividing a number by zero.
NullPointerException	Accessing a null object reference.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException	Accessing an invalid index in an array.
ClassNotFoundException	Class not found during runtime.
IOException	Input-output operation failures (e.g., file not found).
SQLException	Errors during database access.
Advanced Example
Handling Multiple Exceptions
java
Copy code
public class MultiCatchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
            System.out.println(numbers[3]); // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
            int result = 10 / 0;           // ArithmeticException
        } catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
            System.out.println("Array index is out of bounds!");
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Arithmetic error occurred!");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("Cleaning up resources...");
        }
    }
}
Custom Exceptions
You can create your own exception by extending the Exception or RuntimeException class.

java
Copy code
class CustomException extends Exception {
    public CustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

public class CustomExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            throw new CustomException("This is a custom exception!");
        } catch (CustomException e) {
            System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}

throw vs throws:-

	Aspect			throw						throws
	Purpose		Used to explicitly throw an exception.		Declares exceptions that may be thrown by a method.
	Scope			Within a method.				In the method signature.
	Example		throw new IOException("Error");			public void readFile() throws IOException {}
	



Best Practices for Exception Handling:-
	
	Catch Specific Exceptions: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic Exception type.
	
	Use Finally for Cleanup: Always release resources (e.g., close files, database connections) in a finally block or try-with-resources.
	
	Avoid Empty Catch Blocks: Do not leave the catch block empty.
	
	Use Custom Exceptions: Use meaningful exception classes to represent specific issues in your application.
	
	Do Not Overuse Checked Exceptions: Use them sparingly to avoid clutter in method signatures.
